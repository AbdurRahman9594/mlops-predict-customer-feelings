If you try executing the code along with the YouTuber, then at some point of time, you will get an error that "Daemon fucntionality is not supported on Windows". Therefore, to resolve this issue, you need to install WSL (Windows subsystem for Linux) and Ubuntu, on your Windows laptop/computer. To install WSL and Ubuntu, just run your command prompt as Administrator and run the below command:

wsl --install

This will take some time and then you will be asked to restart your computer/laptop. After the restart, open your Ubuntu terminal (remember, not WSL terminal) and give your first name is small letter case and then give an easy password (Note: while entering, the password will not be visible). After that, a directory will be shown. Now, create a folder in Local disk D as "customer_satisfaction" and give that path in the Ubuntu terminal.

For example, the Linux path should be like this: cd /mnt/d/customer_satisfaction

Now, copy or download all the files and folder from my repository in the Local D > customer_satisfaction folder. Also, for the dataset, you can either download it from the YouTubers github or directly download it from Google drive link present in the data folder. (It is not possible for me to upload the 50Mb dataset as the maximum dataset can be uploaded upto 25Mb)
